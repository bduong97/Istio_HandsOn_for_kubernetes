- Kiali is not showing a static picture of your architecture; it's showing a dynamic picture of how requests are traveling between services; So if there are no requests between services, it may not show a line between 2 services even though they are meant to be connected in the overall architecture;
- Istio gives observability into the flow of traffic of your architecture (very useful!)
- When enabling distributed tracing via jaegar, need to propagate headers (potential application changes)
